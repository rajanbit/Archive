>Result
Distance, DDH value, Probability that DDH > 70% (i.e., same species) and Probability that DDH > 79% (i.e., same subspecies) with Formula: 1, 2 and 3
Difference in % G+C

#Note1: Formula 1 utilizes HSP (High-scoring Segment Pairs) length and total lengths of the genome; Formula 2 uses identities and HSP length while Formula 3 uses identities and total lengths
#Note2: preferred formula 2
