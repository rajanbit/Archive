Userâ€™s Guide: http://eddylab.org/software/hmmer/Userguide.pdf

Installation:

$ conda install -c bioconda hmmer 

Usage:

# Construct profile-HMM (pHMM)
$ hmmbuild --amino --cpu 2 seq.hmm seq.aln

# Convert pHMM data to Sequence Logo data
$ hmmlogo seq.hmm > seq.logo

# Output in legacy HMMER2ASCII text format for comparative studies
$ hmmconvert -2 seq.hmm > seq.hmm2

# Generate consensus sequence from hmm
$ hmmemit -c seq.hmm > conseq.fa

# Search profile-HMM against sequence
$ hmmsearch --cpu 2 seq.hmm seq.fasta

# Creating logo from profile-HMM
Upload seq.hmm to [http://skylign.org/]
