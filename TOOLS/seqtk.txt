Tool: seqtk
Perform: Processing sequences in the FASTA or FASTQ format

GitHub: https://github.com/lh3/seqtk
Website: https://docs.csc.fi/apps/seqtk/

Installation:
$ conda install -c bioconda seqtk

Usage: 

Extract sequences from FASTA file
# Note: sequence IDs in subseq.ids file should exactly match with fasta headers in seq.fasta file
$ seqtk subseq seq.fasta subseq.ids > subseq.fasta

Get the nucleotide composition of FASTA
# Output format: chr, length, #A, #C, #G, #T, #2, #3, #4, #CpG, #tv, #ts, #CpG-ts
$ seqtk comp seq.fasta > seq.comp

Identify high or low GC regions
# High GC
$ seqtk gc seq.fasta
# High AT
$ seqtk gc -w seq.fasta

Randomly subsample sequences
$ seqtk sample -s 11 seq.fasta 10
# Note: change -seed(-s) value each time for randomly subsampling 
# value after filename (seq.fasta) is fraction of sequences to extract

Apart from these it also includes other commands which can be explored
$ seqtk
